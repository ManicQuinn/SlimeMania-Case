# SlimeMania-Case
Custom SlimeVR Trackers I am working on, PCB and Case design, optimized for being compact while using breakout boards and also have cable routing in mind so it won't affect the
antenna signal.
3D files are designed in Fusion 360 as that is what I have the most experience with.

Parts: 
1. Wemos D1 Mini V4.0
2. BMI160
3. TP4056 (Type C version)
4. SS12D10 Switch
5. BH-311-1A AA Battery Holder (or similar, "58.3mm x 16.8mm x 13.3mm" is the sizing of the one I 
   modeled it after)
6. 14500 Lithium-Ion Battery

Photos are outdated, but essentially similar enough, same vision.
